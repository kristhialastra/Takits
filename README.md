<span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> leverages Java for its backend development. The backend relies on Apache Tomcat 9 as the server hosting platform, providing seamless communication between the frontend and backend of <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span>. MySQL serves as the database management system, while the Java Servlet API is utilized by <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> to handle communication between the web server and the backend of the application. To establish a connection between the backend code and the MySQL database, <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> utilizes the MySQL Connector/J library, specifically designed for connecting Java applications with MySQL databases. By leveraging these technologies, <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> ensures an efficient system capable of managing appointment booking, scheduling, and data management requirements.

<span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> leverages Java for its backend development. The backend relies on Apache Tomcat 9 as the server hosting platform, providing seamless communication between the frontend and backend of <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span>. MySQL serves as the database management system, while the Java Servlet API is utilized by <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> to handle communication between the web server and the backend of the application. To establish a connection between the backend code and the MySQL database, <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> utilizes the MySQL Connector/J library, specifically designed for connecting Java applications with MySQL databases. By leveraging these technologies, <span style="color:#ff8c00">Takits</span> ensures an efficient system capable of managing appointment booking, scheduling, and data management requirements.

## Instructions on How to Run the Web App Locally

1. Ensure that you have already downloaded and installed the necessary software: Eclipse for Web Developer, Apache Tomcat, and MySQL.

2. Download the project zip file.

3. Extract the zip file into the `eclipse-workspace` directory on your local machine.

4. Open the Eclipse software.

5. Navigate to ` File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace > Takits Folder > Click Inner Takits Folder > Select Folder > Finish`.

6. In the Import dialog, browse to the `Takits` folder inside the `eclipse-workspace` directory. Click on the inner `Takits` folder > Select Folder > Finish.

7. You will now see the project in the "Project Explorer" pane on the left side of the Eclipse interface.

8. Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer, go to `Build Path > Add External Jars`. Here, add the MySQL Jar File and Servlet API. Then click Apply and Close.

9. In the Project Explorer, expand the project and go to `Java Resources > Src > com.mvc.connection`. Open the relevant file and update the database password to match your MySQL password. Save the changes (Ctrl + S).

10. Open your MySQL interface (like MySQL Workbench or command line), and create the database using the provided SQL Query.

11. Back in Eclipse, start the server by right-clicking on the project in the Project Explorer, selecting `Run As > Run on Server`.

12. If prompted, choose the Apache Tomcat server and click Finish.

13. The application should now be running locally. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `localhost:8080/Takits` (or the appropriate port number if not 8080).
